The MongoDB database is hosted on Microsoft Azure which is scalable.  

The application uses Azure to auto-scale and provide quality reliable hosting.   
We Are Using Customer's Location as a starting point, and taking his parking choice from his click, and after that we employ the Geocoding API of MapmyIndia to find out the coordinates and hence generate the route b/w the 2 points. We have created an interface for the parking operators which facilitates the registration of their parking space on our wesbite, where they can manage real-time occupation of parking space.   

It also helps the client (user) to find the shortest route to the destination on the map itself.
